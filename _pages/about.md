Welcome to my website! My name is Sandra Martínez Gutiérrez, last-year undergraduate Economics student, and this is my online presence. I am currently a Research Assistant at the Behavioural Economics' Laboratory from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. My research interests are, but not limited to, the following:

* Data Science

* Data Analytics

* Finance

* Applied Microeconomics


Next to economics, I am also passionate about computer science and programming. Parallel to my B.S., I have familiarized myself with the theory of algorithms & data structures and have a solid foundation in languages such as Python, R, Stata, Matlab, E-views, SQL, Power-BI, anf Tableu.


On the less professional side of things, I am also quite interested in learning new languages, architectural history, and, on top of that, I have a passionate interest in cinema, film theory and film criticism. But these things are better discussed in person!
